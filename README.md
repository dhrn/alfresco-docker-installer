# generator-alfresco-docker-installer
> Alfresco Docker Installer

Since Alfresco Installer was discontinued from Alfresco 5.2, this project provides a command line installer for Alfresco Community 6.1 to be used in Docker Compose installations.

This project generates a Docker Compose template ready to be used including following features:

* RAM limits for every service according to global memory available for Docker
* PostgreSQL or MariaDB as database (no other option but MySQL is supported for Community)
* Search Services configured for environments using several languages for contents or from operative systems / browsers
* Outbound Email service (smtp)
* LDAP service for identification (based in OpenLDAP)
* Several addons available

>> This generator creates a base Docker Template with the configuration selected, but you should review volumes, configuration, modules & tuning parameters before using this composition in Production environments.

## Installation

This program has following dependencies:

* Node.js
* Yeoman

You can download and install `Node.js` from official web page:

https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Or you can use any of the package managers provided by the product:

https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/

Once Node.js is installed, you can install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) as a module:

```bash
$ npm install -g yo
```

And finally, you can install this generator:

```bash
$ npm install --global generator-alfresco-docker-installer
```

Deployment is provided for Docker Compose, so following dependencies must be satisfied by the server used to run the generated configuration:

* Docker
* Docker Compose

You can install *Docker Desktop* for Windows or Mac and *Docker Server* for Linux.

https://docs.docker.com/install/

You need also to add *Docker Compose* program to your installation.

https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/


## Building

The module is available at **npm**:

https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-alfresco-docker-installer

If you want to build it locally, you need an environment with Node.js and Yeoman. And from the root folder of the project, just type:

```bash
$ npm link
```

## Running

Create a folder where Docker Compose template files are going to be produced and run the generator.

```
$ mkdir docker-compose
$ cd docker-compose

$ yo alfresco-docker-installer
```

Several options are provided in order to build the configuration.

```
? Which ACS version do you want to use (6.2 is EA only)? 6.1
```

Currently Alfresco Community 6.1 is final, but 6.2 is stil Early Access. If you are planning a longer evaluation, don't use 6.2 by now.

```
? How may GB RAM are available for Alfresco (8 is minimum required)? 8
```

Alfresco platform could work with less than 8 GB RAM, but it's recommended to provide at least 8 GB in your Docker server. This generator will limit the amount of memory for every service in order to match your resources.

```
Do you want to use HTTPs for Web Proxy?
```

This option enables HTTPs for every service. Default SSL certificates (public and private) are provided in `config/cert` folder. These certificates are not recommended for prod environments, so it's required to replace these files with your own certificates. 

```
What is the name of your server?
```

If you are deploying on a server different than `localhost`, include in this option the name of your server. For instance: `alfresco.com`

```
? What HTTP port do you want to use (all the services are using the same port)? 80 or 443
```

HTTP port to be used by every service. If you are running on a Linux computer, you'll need to specify a port greater than 1024 when not starting as `root` user.

```
? Do you want to use MariaDB instead of PostgreSQL? No
```

Alfresco uses PostgreSQL by default, but alternatively `MariaDB` can be used as database.

```
? Are you using different languages (this is the most common scenario)? Yes
```

By default, many organisations are storing document in different languages or the users are accessing the platform with browser configured in different languages. If this is your case, enable this configuration.

```
? Do you want to create an internal SMTP server? No
```

This service provides an internal SMTP server (for outgoing emails) based in a Postfix Relay. If you want to use your own mail server, you can configure it manually after the generation of the Docker Compose template.

```
? Do you want to create an internal LDAP server? No
```

This service provides an internal OpenLDAP server (for authentication). If you want to use your own LDAP or AD server, you can configure it manually after the generation of the Docker Compose template.

```
? Select the addons to be installed:
  JavaScript Console 0.6                 : https://github.com/share-extras/js-console
  Order of the Bee Support Tools 1.1.0.0 : https://github.com/OrderOfTheBee/ootbee-support-tools
  Share Site Creators 0.0.7              : https://github.com/jpotts/share-site-creators
  Simple OCR 2.3.1                       : https://github.com/keensoft/alfresco-simple-ocr
  ESign Cert 1.8.2                       : https://github.com/keensoft/alfresco-esign-cert
```

A small catalog of trusted *addons* is provided by default, but you can install any other using the deployment folders.

## Passing parameters from command line

Default values for options can be specified in the command line, using a `--name=value` pattern. When an options is specified in the command line, the question is not prompted to the user, so you can generate a Docker Compose template with no user interaction.

```
$ yo alfresco-docker-installer --acsVersion=6.1
```

**Parameter names reference**

* `--acsVersion`: 6.1 or 6.2 (early access only)
* `--ram`: number of GB available for Docker
* `--mariadb`: true or false
* `--crossLocale`: true or false
* `--smtp`: true or false
* `--ldap`: true or false
* `--addons`: list of addons to be installed: js-console, ootbee-support-tools, share-site-creators, simple-ocr, esign-cert

## Deploying additional addons

If you want to deploy additional addons, use deployment folders for Alfresco and Share services.

**Alfresco**

```
├── alfresco
│   ├── modules             > Deployment directory for addons
│   │   ├── amps            > Repository addons with AMP format
│   │   └── jars            > Repository addons with JAR format
```

**Share**

```
└── share                   
    └── modules             > Deployment directory for addons
        ├── amps            > Share addons with AMP format
        └── jars            > Share addons with JAR format
```

## Using Docker Compose

Once the files have been generated, review that configuration is what you expected and add or modify any other settings. After that, just start Docker Compose.

```
$ docker-compose up --build --force-recreate -d
```

You can shutdown it at any moment using following command.

```
$ docker-compose down
```

Following folder structure is generated when Docker Compose is running. Depending on the configuration selected, some folders cannot be available in your server.
